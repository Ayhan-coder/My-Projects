					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
					You are given an integer list and a target number. Find all (x, y) pairs in the list that their sum is equal to the target number. 
					The numbers in the pair should be distinct. You can not use the same number twice.<br>
					</p>
					<p> User will enter two inputs: <br>
						<ul>
							<li>
								A whitespace separated list of non-negative numbers.
							</li>
							<li>
								The target number. You can assume that it will be a positive integer.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>You need to print all the x, y pairs that satisfies the condition.</p>
					<p>
						<b>Important Note:</b> Order in the pairs matters. For example, if the list contains 1 and 2, and the target number is 3, you should print both (1, 2) and (2, 1). Order of the pairs in the output matters too, you should print them in the order they appear in the list. (see examples below)
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Important Note:</b> The list is given to you in the code with the variable name <code>numbers</code>, we handled the input taking. You can assume that the list will be valid, will not have duplicates and will contain at least one pair that their sum is equal to the target number. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Check the examples for further clarification. Keep in mind that we will be grading your code not just based on these examples, but other cases as well,	so try to write code which can handle all possible cases.
					</p>
