					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
					In this problem, you are expected to find the number of words and letters inside a given sentence. <br>
					</p>
					<p> User will enter 1 input, which will be the sentence itself.	You can safely assume that the sentence only consists of letters, <br>
						empty spaces, and a dot (.) at the end. The sentence will always end with a dot (.).
					</p>
					<p>Depending on the input, you need to print:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>The number of words inside the sentence (as first output)</li>
					<li>The number of letters inside the sentence (as second output)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

						Check the examples for further clarification. Keep in mind that we will be grading your code not just based on these examples, but other cases as well,	so try to write code which can handle all possible cases.
