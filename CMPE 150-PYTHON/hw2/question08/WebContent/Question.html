					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
					In this problem, you are given names of n students and for each student you are given 3 exam grades. Your task is to find the student with the highest average<br>
					</p>
					<p>
						If two students has the same average, print the name of the student whose name appears later in the input list. <br>
						</p>
					<p> 
						It is guaranteed that all scores are positive.				
					</p>
					<p>
						Input can have any size bigger than 1, however:
						<ul>
							<li>First line is a positive integer. It is the number of students that will be provided as input.</li>
							<li>Remaning lines will follow the pattern <code>NAME GRADE1 GRADE2 GRADE3</code> as you can see in the examples.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Depending on your input,	 you need to print:  </p>
					<ul>
					<li>Name of the student who has the highest average grade.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
					<p>
						Check the examples for further clarification. Keep in mind that we will be grading your code not just based on these examples, but other cases as well,	so try to write code which can handle all possible cases.
