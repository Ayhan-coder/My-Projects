					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
					In this problem, you are given exam notes for n students. Your task is to find the second highest grade in the class.<br>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Important:</b> Input taking part is handled for you. Variable <code>n</code> is the number of students and the variable <code>scores</code> is a list of integers that contain all of the scores. <br>
						</p>
					<p> 
						It is guaranteed that all scores are positive.				
					</p>
					<p>Depending on your input numbers, you need to print:  </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Second highest grade in the class.</li>
						<li>If all of the grades are same (meaning there is no second highest grade), you should print -1.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
					<p>
						Check the examples for further clarification. Keep in mind that we will be grading your code not just based on these examples, but other cases as well,	so try to write code which can handle all possible cases.
					</p>
