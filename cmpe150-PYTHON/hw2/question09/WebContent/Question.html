            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
              In this problem, you are given a week's temperatures in Celsius.
              You are expected to convert it to Fahrenheit and print the
              corresponding statement. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              The formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is: <br />
              <code>F = (9/5) * C + 32</code> <br />
              where <code>F</code> is the Fahrenheit value and <code>C</code> is
              the Celsius value. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Warning:</b>Input taking is handled for you. The variable <code>temperatures</code> is a list of 7 integers representing the temperatures of a week (in order) in
              Celsius. You can assume this list will always contain positive integers.<br />
            </p>
            <p> <ul>
              <li>
                If the Fahrenheit value for a day is greater than 80, print <code>It's hot on day <i>{day_number}</i></code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                If it is less than 60 (not inclusive), print <code> It's cold on day <i>{day_number}</i></i></code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                If it is in between, print <code>It's warm on day <i>{day_number}</i></code>. 
              </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

              Check the examples for further clarification. Keep in mind that we
              will be grading your code not just based on these examples, but
              other cases as well, so try to write code which can handle all
              possible cases.
