					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
					In this problem, you are given a word with n characters. Your task is to check whether the word is palindrome or not.<br>
					</p>
					<p>
						When a word is read the same backwards as forwards, that word is called <b>palindrome</b>.
					</p>
					<p>There are 2 inputs:
					</p>
					<ul>
					<li>First input is a positive integer.</li>
					<li>Second input is an english word</li>
					</ul>
					<p> 
						It is guaranteed that all letters are lowercase, you don't need to think about case sensitivity.				
					</p>
					<p> 
						However output is case sensivite, please be careful about upper and lower cases when printing. Print "YES" or "NO"!				
					</p>
					<p>Depending on your input numbers, you need to print:  </p>
					<ul>
					<li>"YES" if the word is a palindrome.</li>
					<li>"NO" if the word is not a palindrome.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><b>Important:</b> Input taking is already done by us and shouldn't be written by you.</p>
					<p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
					<p>
						Check the examples for further clarification. Keep in mind that we will be grading your code not just based on these examples, but other cases as well,	so try to write code which can handle all possible cases.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Warning:</b> You are not allowed to use any imports and any topics that haven't been covered this semester.
