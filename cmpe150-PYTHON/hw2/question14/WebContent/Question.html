					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
					In this problem, given an integer n, you are expected to find the numbers which are smaller than n and coprime with n. <br>
					Two numbers a and b are coprime if their greatest common divisor is 1 (in other words, no number greater than 1 can divide both a and b).
					</p>
					<p> User will enter 1 input, which will be the number n. (You can assume it will always be an integer that is bigger than 1.)		
					</p>
					<p>Depending on the number n, you need to print: </p>
					<ul>
					<li>The amount of numbers which are smaller than n and coprime with n.</li>
					</ul>
